Mapping Black Rome is a digital humanities project that grew out of Melanie Masterton Sherazi’s 2024 winter English course,
"African American Expatriate Culture in Postwar Europe," at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena, California.
The map’s entries emerged from our thinking together in the course and was initiated by research conducted by students including Bea Avila-Rimer,
Ankita Nandi, and Favour E. Okodogbe. This project is ongoing. We welcome suggestions, as well as additions to our Bibliography page.
