            screenwriter, script translator, actor, and journalist [1]. He alludes to his experiences in his

            living in Rome in the early 1960s with his Italian wife and son and writing a novel within the novel about
            a Black actress, Doris. In the postwar period, the Piazza del Popolo and surrounding streets stretching to the
            Spanish Steps, were filmmaker haunts, including cafes like <b><u>Rosati</u></b> and <b><u>Canova</u></b>.
            Nearby, the <b><u>Via Margutta</u></b> was lined with artist studios.

          <b>Ben Johnson</b> was a prolific African American translator of Italian modern literature into English, actor, editor, and writer 
          who lived in postwar Rome [1]. Before settling in Rome, he served in Italy during WWII, and then returned to the United States to 
          earn his degree at Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. There, he met writer <a href="#map1">William Demby</a> and stayed in close
          contact with him when he moved to Rome in the late 1940s. Johnson translated into English many groundbreaking modern and contemporary
          Italian literary texts, including works by Italo Svevo; Johnson was Italo Calvino’s first translator into English. Johnson worked as an
          editor on the cutting-edge, Rome-based journal <a href="#map1">Botteghe Oscure</a>.</p> 

          <p class="context">Johnson starred in a 1952 retelling of <i>Othello</i> set in Rome, <a href="#map1"><i>Anna’s Sin</i> (<i>Il peccato di Anna</i>)</a> [2], in which his 
            friend writer <b>William Demby</b> also played a substantive role. The film features the Villa Borghese gallery in one of its key scenes
            [Figure 1]. The Villa Borghese gallery is one of the most famous art galleries in the world, containing paintings, sculptures and antiquities.

          <p class="context">
           Originally from Chicago, Harold Bradley moved to Italy in 1959 to study at the University for Foreigners in Perugia, Italy.
           While in Italy, he founded the cultural hub Folkstudio in 1961 in Rome’s Trastevere neighborhood, with art exhibitions in
           the day that morphed into a jazz club by night, frequented by artists and musicians including Bob Dylan, Pete Seeger, 
           and Ravi Shankar. Bradley was accomplished in a multitude of different fields. He starred in over a dozen Italian films,
           even making appearances as an extra in the film Cleopatra with Elizabeth Taylor. He was a painter, musician, educator,
           art historian, film, theater actor, football player as well as a constant patron for African American influence in the arts. 
           After moving back to the United States in 1968, he taught at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and produced and 
           hosted three prime-time public affairs shows where he focused on race and intercultural issues [1].

          <h3>John Rhoden</h3>
          <p class="context">
           John Rhoden was born March 13, 1916, and showed artistic promise from a young age. He went on to join the 
           military and during his time serving he completed the busts of several high-ranking officers. After the 
           military, he attended the New School for Social Research and then Columbia University which eventually led
            him to his time at the American Academy in Rome in 1951 to 1954. While in Rome, Rhoden, the first Black 
            visual artist to be in residence at the Academy, created a towering bronze sculpture whose “lithe organicism
            and integration of figuration and abstraction presaged the style that would characterize his art for years 
            to come” [1]. </p>

          <p class="context">
            Rhoden’s time in Rome uniquely shaped his artistic style and caught the attention of the United States 
            Department of State who recruited him to serve as an art specialist from 1955 through 1959. His time abroad, and
           especially in Rome, established Rhoden as a prominent sculptor of the time and allowed for exploration of a multitude
            of cultures and artistic representations.

            <p class="quote">
              My wife and I were living the dormitory life of the American Academy in Rome and I was much preoccupied: 
              with writing a novel, with literary concepts, with reviewing my own life’s resources for literary creation;
               with the experience of discovering a foreign culture in which the old structures and guides that sustained 
               my thoughts, emotions and conduct at home were so relaxed, whether awake or sleeping, that it was as though
               I was living in a barely controlled chaos. (Ellison, “Tell It Like It Is, Baby”) </p>

              Writer Ralph Ellison spent two years as a Rome Prize Fellow in Literature at the American Academy in Rome from
               1955-1957, following the publication of his first, critically acclaimed novel Invisible Man. There, he would 
               begin drafting his second novel, which was to remain forever in progress, but was published posthumously in two
                edited variants, Juneteenth and Three Days Before the Shooting [1]. </p>
            <p class="context">
              Seemingly disillusioned with the Eternal City, Ellison observed in a letter sent from Rome to his best friend Albert
               Murray that “the best of Rome remains its past” [2].

          <h3>William Demby</h3>
          <p class="quote">
            Today is May 12, [1962], Doris and the Count are here to watch the TV program Il Signore delle 21: Harlem, in 
            which I appear as a kind of assistant master of ceremonies, together with Louis Armstrong, Sammy Davis, Hazel Scott,
            the Peters Sisters and many other stars of the Negro entertainment world. I know that this is the first time that so
             many Negro entertainers have appeared at one time on a European television program and I am frankly apprehensive.
             Strange things happened during the Ampex recording of the program. For years I had lived under the illusion that 
             racial prejudice does not exist in Italy, which has now become my second patria—And yet—had I been imagining things?
             (Demby, The Catacombs 49-50)</p>

          <p class="context">
            Writer William Demby was asked to MC an episode of the Italian variety show Il signore delle 21, an experience he would 
            fold into his semi-autobiographical novel The Catacombs. Demby’s idea for the episode was “to say, ‘Hey Louis, what’s 
            Harlem?’ And I told him that, when I asked that, he should say, ‘Harlem is…,’ and then start playing” (qtd. in Micconi 134–35)
           [1]. Demby affirmed, “Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald were happy to see a Black guy on European television… To them 
           I was an early example of the Civil Rights revolution having transformed the racial situation in Italy” (qtd. Micconi 135).</p>
          <p class="context">
            The Italian variety show Il Signore delle 21 filmed at RAI Studios, the public Italian broadcasting company (radio and television). 
            The company started with radio broadcasting in 1924 and added television programs in 1954 [2]. Il Signore delle 21 aired in the 
            early 1960s and filmed at the Teatro delle Vittorie, an iconic RAI studio in Rome [3].

            William Demby was stationed in Italy during World War II. After graduating from Fisk University after the war, he
            returned to Italy in 1947 and worked as a novelist, actor, journalist, screenwriter, and translator of Italian 
            film scripts [1]. In 1953, he married Italian poet, novelist, translator, and literary agent Lucia Drudi 
            [EXTERNAL LINK TO: https://www.enciclopediadelledonne.it/edd.nsf/biografie/lucia-drudi-demby], with whom he would

            Via Margutta, where Demby first lived in Rome upon his return in 1947, is a lane off the Piazza del Popolo that hosted
             many artists’ studios and living spaces. Not long after, Demby would move into a shared flat with several artists

            In the 19th century, American artists were drawn to the area near the Spanish Steps, notably African American and Native
            American sculptor Edmonia Lewis, who had a studio on the Via Margutta in the former studio of the renowned Italian sculptor
            Canova (1757-1822). Lewis’s work showcased African American and Native American women, often in marble, once she moved to Rome.
            Specifically, she highlighted the oppression of Black people and celebrated her own Native American heritage. Lewis did her own
            stonework to ensure it was accepted as her original work, rather than following the standard practice of hiring workmen to carve 
            the final piece [3] (Link to: Edmonia Lewis | Smithsonian American Art Museum https://americanart.si.edu/artist/edmonia-lewis-2914.).

          <h3>John Kitzmiller, Katherine Dunham and Ben Johnson</h3>
          <p class="context">
            Cinecittà Studios continues to make movies to this day, with eighteen stages and five permanent sets for settings such as
            Ancient Rome and a 20th Century City. The studio hosts films by both domestic and international producers, as supported 
            by tax credits from the Italian government [1]. The studio gave rise to a boom known as Hollywood on the Tiber in the 1950s,
            a time in which a number of African American performers took up on screen roles, ranging from lead roles to extra work.  </p>

          <p class="context">
            John Kitzmiller’s successful acting career in Rome began with Vivere in pace (To Live in Peace) filmed at Cinecittà Studios 
            in 1947 [2]. Although he had a long career in Rome, he is best known in the United States for his role as Quarrel in the James
            Bond film Dr. No [3]. </p>
          
          <p class="context">
            Kitzmiller’s stay in Rome was unanticipated, as he was an engineer and not an actor when offered the role in Vivere in pace by
            director Luigi Zampa. At the end of World War II, however, Kitzmiller had no inclination to return home to Michigan, as both
            his parents died during the war and his sister was moving to Detroit. Kitzmiller told his hometown paper in 1960, “At that time,
            thousands of discharged GIs were looking for jobs, so I figured I’d let them get settled down first” [4]. Although Kitzmiller’s
            on-screen performance was received positively in Italy, American critics highlighted the perpetuation of racist stereotypes of 
            Black men, which continued through his later roles in films such as Tombolo [5]. Kitzmiller won “Best Actor” at the Cannes Film 
            Festival in 1957 for his role in the Valley of Peace.</p>

          <p class="context">
            Though Kitzmiller was one of the leading Black actors working in Rome in this period, other luminaries included Katherine Dunham 
            who worked in the Italian cinema in such films as Mambo and whose dance method was taught in Rome. Edith Peters, who sang with her 
            sisters, The Peters Sisters, appeared in a number of Italian films in the 1950s and 1960s.  </p>

          <p class="context">
            In and around Rome, other productions featured Black talent on screen. Ben Johnson starred in <i>Il peccato di Anna</i>, a retelling of
            <i>Othello</i> set in 1950s Rome, in which William Demby also played a substantive supporting role as a Black expatriate jazz musician.

          <h2>Roman Bricktop’s on the Via Veneto</h2> 
          <img id="location-image" src="imgs/piazza_del_popolo.jpg" alt="Piazza del Popolo">
          <h3>Bricktop</h3>
          <p class="quote">
            The Rome American raved, ‘Bricktop’s opening last night at the ABC Room of the Hotel Ambassador was in the old tradition—a
             setting jampacked with celebrities, and Bricktop herself the same warm and wonderful personality that has made her famous
              throughout the world.’ (Bricktop with James Haskins, Bricktop 253).   </p>

          <p class="context">
            After her iconic run as a performer and clubowner in interwar Paris, Ada “Bricktop” Smith opened up Roman Bricktop’s in early
             1951 in the Ambassador Hotel with Charlie Lewis’s band, near Doney’s Restaurant on the Via Veneto. While it received praise
            and buzz, there was a decline in business as time went on. Bricktop pivoted and reopened her club in a second location in
             “a room behind a florist’s shop on the Via Veneto.” The building, however, was owned by priests, who “objected to the music
            in the small hours of the morning. They didn’t make [Bricktop] close the club, but they did stop the music, and what was
            Bricktop’s without music? [Bricktop’s] stayed at the florist-shop location only a few months” (Bricktop 258). This led
            to her final location, the one most associated with Roman Bricktop’s, which was in a cellar on the Via Veneto, a location found
            by her friend Jody Desmond. “I was never crazy about the place,” Bricktop recalled.” “The décor was more that of a restaurant than
            a nightclub. It was very chic, but it didn’t have that intimacy. A lot of my clients confessed that they didn’t like it either,
           but eventually we changed it around” (Bricktop 258).  </p>
          
          <p class="context">
            Bricktop’s club was a hot spot during the period of “Hollywood on the Tiber” and was frequented by celebrities including actress
             Anna Magnani, Bricktop’s close friend, who gathered to hear Bricktop’s nightly performance of “Miss Otis Regrets,” penned for her
             by her friend Cole Porter. In Rome, Bricktop was known as the “Holy Hustler” for her twinned business savvy and staunch commitment
             to philanthropy, the latter which grew out of her wartime conversion to Catholicism. Bricktop ran her club in Rome until 1964, when
             she announced her retirement and return to the States (Bricktop 279). </p>
